# CS4200 - Artificial Intelligence Project

The goal of this project is to predict COVID-19 cases in California. Identifying this issue as a time series forecasting project, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using a specialized layer called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) was determined ideal for processing and predicting the desired project outcome. Specifically, this project deals with a univariate time series (Total Count Confirmed) to make predictions for the future. The project utilizes the TensorFlow module, a core open-source library, to help develop and train my machine learning model, as well as using Matplotlib to help visualize the data.
